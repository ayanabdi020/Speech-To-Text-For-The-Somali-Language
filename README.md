# Speech To Text For The Somali Language 

## Introduction
Although the Somali language has been spoken for centuries, there has been little research on developing speech-to-text models for this language. This paper proposes a machine learning model for creating speech-to-text for the Somali language. We train our model with a data set of Somali audio recordings and corresponding transcriptions.

## Model
These step might be used to create our model. Check the *model* folder for more details.
